# 100-Days-of-Code
Learning Python


I'm trying to learn python and how to use GitHub and this is my very first project.

I'm doing the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022 by Dr. Angela Yu

100 days, 1 hour per day, build 1 project per day.

Everyday will contain some excercises and a project/miniproject
